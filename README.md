# JunkXZL:
JunkXZL is a guy that exists and that's what I know.

## Original:
Please go to [the original site]([https://pages.github.com/](https://junkxzl.github.io/XZL/)) for better inquerie onto what he's about!

### Why?
I wanted to help him out onto his start of making a **good** HTML site using CSS and not JS because there isn't really a need for that in this website yet.

# Update 3.0:
JavaScript or JS is used now and so is the audio API and iframes, there also is now other stuff you'll just have to see.
